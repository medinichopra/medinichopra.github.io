 # Minimalist Page

This repository contains the code for a minimalist personal website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/medinichopra/minimalist-page.git
```

Once the repository is cloned, open the `index.html` file in a text editor. This file contains the HTML code for the website.

## HTML

The HTML code for the website is relatively simple. The `<head>` section contains the title of the page and links to the CSS and JavaScript files. The `<body>` section contains the content of the page, which includes a navigation bar, a hero section, and a grid of content.

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is located at the top of the page and contains links to the about, resume, and contact pages. The navigation bar is created using the `<nav>` and `<ul>` elements.

```html
<nav class="navbar">
  <ul>
    <li class="logo">medinichopra</li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Resume</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Hero Section

The hero section is located below the navigation bar and contains a special sentence and a link to the data and dance sections. The hero section is created using the `<p>` and `<a>` elements.

```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="special-sentence">
    I like telling stories through <a href="#" class="underline-link" id="dataLink">data</a> and
    <a href="#" class="underline-link" id="danceLink">dance</a>.
  </p>
</div>
```

### Grid of Content

The grid of content is located below the hero section and contains two grids, one for data and one for dance. Each grid item contains an image, a description, and a link to learn more. The grid of content is created using the `<div>` and `<a>` elements.

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="data-grid">
    <div class="grid-item">
      <img src
